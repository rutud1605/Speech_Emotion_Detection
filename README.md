# 📌 Speech Sentiment and Emotion Detection

## 🔍 Introduction
Speech Sentiment and Emotion Detection is an AI-powered solution designed to accurately analyze emotions in speech. This project enhances the interaction experience for customers/clients engaging with businesses or organizations via chatbots and voice assistants.

## 🎯 Objectives
  - Detect and analyze human emotions from spoken language.
  - Improve online customer interaction experiences through sentiment-aware AI.
  - Train models using multilingual and accented datasets for cross-linguistic robustness.
  
## 📊 Dataset
We used the CREMA (Crowd Sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors) dataset, which:
  - Contains high-quality multilingual audio with different accents.
  - Includes background noise to simulate real-world conditions.
  - Features expert-labeled emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.
  - Offers a large corpus for robust AI training and prevents overfitting.
  
## 🎛 Data Augmentation
To enhance model generalization, we applied:
  - Pitch Modification – Alters the frequency of the speech.
  - Noise Injection – Adds random background noise.
  - Time Shifting – Moves the audio signal forward or backward.
  - Stretching – Expands or compresses audio duration.
  
## 🧠 Model Architecture
We used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for emotion detection. The architecture includes:
  - Convolutional Layers – Extract features from speech signals.
  - Pooling & Dropout Layers – Reduce dimensionality and prevent overfitting.
  - Activation Functions – Improve non-linearity and model expressiveness.
  
## 🚀 Training and Validation
  - The model was trained using CREMA data with deep learning techniques.
  - Augmentation techniques improved robustness to variations in speech.
  - Achieved high accuracy in real-world speech emotion recognition.
  
## 🏆 Results & Conclusion
Our system: 
- ✅ Accurately detects sentiments and emotions from speech signals.
- ✅ Works under different conditions, including noise and accents.
- ✅ Handles multiple languages effectively for real-world applications.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) for feature extraction
- CNN & LSTM for emotion classification
